# Keyword-Extractor
In this project, I have seen and worked on different approaches to extract keywords from a given text. All of them don’t require any pre training on a dataset. This list of algorithm and method is far from being complete, we can also test other approached but for now this will do. Here, I have both simple approaches like TF-IDF and advanced models like BERT. Unfortunately, there isn’t a model that performs well on every document. It depends on the type of document, the context, and the corpus used for the model pre-training (if required). A more complete preprocessing with a combination of different keyword extraction approaches should definitely improve the performance. But one highlight of all these approaches is the fast execution and implementation of their codes. The RAKE and YAKE with their associate modules works exceptionally well and stand out with the use case example with their faster execution and easy implementation. Gensim and TextRank are also good for keywork extraction.
